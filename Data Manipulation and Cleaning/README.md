# 📘 README - Data Cleaning, Imputation, and Outlier Detection in R

## 📝 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on comprehensive data preprocessing, involving **missing data handling**, **imputation**, and **outlier detection**. The objective is to explore and clean a real-world biological and health-related dataset to ensure analytical accuracy and reliability in further statistical modeling. The project workflow includes data exploration, pattern recognition of missing values, implementation of multiple imputation techniques, and identifying potential outliers using visualization tools.

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset comprises a range of **biological and clinical measurements**, including variables such as **lipid profiles, hormone levels, and other metabolic indicators**. The data is partially incomplete and requires imputation for missing entries.

Key attributes:
- Continuous and categorical variables
- Natural occurrence of missingness
- Biological metrics (e.g., triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, hormone levels)

## 🧪 R Version & Packages Used

- **R version**: `4.4.3`
- Key Packages:
  - `mice` – for Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations
  - `VIM` – for missing data visualization
  - `ggplot2` – for advanced data visualization
  - `dplyr`, `tidyr` – for data manipulation and wrangling
  - `naniar` – for visualizing missing data patterns

---

## 🔁 Procedures Used

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics and visualization to understand data structure and distribution
   - Identification of missing data patterns

2. **Missing Data Mechanism Assessment**
   - Little’s MCAR test used to determine if missingness is completely at random

3. **Imputation Methods**
   - **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)**: Retains original data distribution by imputing values based on observed cases
   - **Random Forest (RF)**: Non-parametric, ensemble-based approach for robust imputation

4. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots generated pre- and post-imputation to flag potential outliers
   - Distribution visualizations for comparison and verification of imputation integrity

5. **Validation & Export**
   - Final imputed dataset saved to CSV
   - Graphs and analysis output stored for interpretation



## ✅ Summary

This project provides a foundational workflow for handling incomplete datasets using statistical and machine learning-based imputation techniques in R. It ensures improved data quality for subsequent analyses while showcasing reproducible techniques in data science pipelines.
